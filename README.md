# AIML – MLE – MLOps 2026

Structured and disciplined preparation toward becoming a **Machine Learning Engineer with strong MLOps capabilities** by September 2026.

This repository is not random practice code.  
It is a documented journey of building real capability.

---

##  Objective

To transition from fundamentals (programming + problem solving)  
→ Machine Learning  
→ Deep Learning  
→ Production-grade MLOps  

With the end goal of being industry-ready for high-paying MLE roles.

##  Roadmap Structure

### Phase 1: Programming & Foundations
- Python fundamentals
- Control flow & loops
- Data structures
- Problem solving (LeetCode)
- Git & version control
- Clean coding practices

 Example:
- `Day-1/`
- `Day-2/` → Loop logic, step reasoning, range behavior analysis

---

### Phase 2: Data Handling & Analysis
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Basic statistics

---

### Phase 3: Machine Learning
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Model evaluation
- Feature engineering
- Scikit-learn

---

### Phase 4: Deep Learning
- Neural Networks
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- CNNs
- RNNs
- Model optimization

---

### Phase 5: MLOps & Deployment
- Model packaging
- Docker
- APIs (FastAPI)
- CI/CD
- Cloud deployment
- Monitoring & logging

---

##  Daily Progress Philosophy

Each folder represents:

- Concept understanding
- Code implementation
- Edge case analysis
- Logical reasoning
- Documentation

The goal is not just writing code.  
The goal is understanding **why it works and when it fails.**

Example:
- Understanding empty ranges in loops
- Step size behavior in `range()`
- Logical flow validation before execution

---

##  Tech Stack (Evolving)

- Python
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code
- Linux basics (planned)
- Docker (planned)
- Cloud (planned)

---

##  Rules I Follow in This Repository

1. No random code dumping.
2. Every concept must be understood before moving forward.
3. Consistent folder structure.
4. Clear commit messages.
5. Continuous progression toward MLE-level thinking.

---

##  Long-Term Goal

To build:
- Production-ready ML systems
- Deployable models
- Scalable pipelines
- Industry-level engineering standards

This repository tracks the process.

---

##  Current Focus

Building strong programming fundamentals  
and logical problem-solving ability.

Because without strong foundations, advanced ML is fragile.
